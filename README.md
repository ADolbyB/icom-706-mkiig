## 🔧 Repair & Modification Guides

### MARS/CAP Modification

[![MARS Mod Guide](https://img.shields.io/badge/PDF-MkIIG_MARS_Mod_Guide-blue?style=for-the-badge&logo=latex&logoColor=red)](https://github.com/ADolbyB/icom-706-mkiig/blob/main/docs/OOBmod/OOBmod.pdf)

**What is MARS/CAP?**  
- **MARS:** Military Auxiliary Radio System  
- **CAP:** Civil Air Patrol  
- Enables transmit capability outside amateur radio bands  
- **Required for 60m ham band operation**  
   - Current ARRL [Frequency Band Chart](https://www.arrl.org/graphical-frequency-allocations) chart
   - 12/2025 FCC update [announcement](https://www.arrl.org/news/fcc-allocates-60-meter-world-wide-amateur-band-approved-at-wrc-15-continues-amateur-use-of-four-addi)


**Modification Details:**
- Extends transmit range beyond ham bands
- Used for emergency communications
- Documented step-by-step procedure
- Reversible modification

> ⚠️ **Legal Notice:** 60m is legal for hams to operate on a secondary basis due to updated rules. Operation in the 60 meter ham band (5.3 - 5.4 MHz) was allocated after the production of this radio. Here is the current ARRL [Frequency Band Chart](https://www.arrl.org/graphical-frequency-allocations). At the time of this writing, the FCC has also [allocated new spectrum](https://www.arrl.org/news/fcc-allocates-60-meter-world-wide-amateur-band-approved-at-wrc-15-continues-amateur-use-of-four-addi) in the 60m band as well.

## ⚡ Performance Tips

### Maximizing Radio Performance

**Power Supply:**
- Use **13.8V DC @ 23A minimum**
- Heavy gauge wire (10 AWG or larger)
- Keep leads short to minimize voltage drop
- Add ferrite chokes for RFI suppression

**Antenna System:**
- Use [AH-4 Auto tuner](https://www.eham.net/reviews/view-product/1071)
- AH-4 Comes weather proof with quality coax for outdoor use.
- Find a [long whip](https://www.eham.net/reviews/view-product?id=5037) and connect to the AH-4
- Works great in my truck with this [Breedlove QD Ball Mount](https://breedlovemounts.com/store/ols/products/quick-disconnect-ball-mount-with-ring-terminal-connector) and their [Stake Pocket Bracket](https://breedlovemounts.com/store/ols/products/ezn-stake-pocket-bracket-short-4-degree-top-plate)
- This setup will tune on 80m - 10m with very low SWR.
- Add any other dual-band antenna for VHF/UHF FM operation if needed.

## ⚖️ Legal & Safety

### FCC Regulations

**Amateur Radio Operation:**
- Valid amateur radio license required for transmission
- Must operate within authorized frequency allocations
- Part 97 rules apply to all modifications: [Frequency Band Chart](https://www.arrl.org/graphical-frequency-allocations)
- In this case, we want to enable the 60m (5.3 - 5.4 MHz) Band since it is already a Part 97 Radio.

**MARS/CAP Modifications:**
- Out-of-band transmission requires FCC authorization
- This recently happened (again) in 2025 with the [allocation of the 60m band](https://www.arrl.org/news/fcc-allocates-60-meter-world-wide-amateur-band-approved-at-wrc-15-continues-amateur-use-of-four-addi) since the production of this radio began.
- It's up to the operator to verify they are operating within specifications.

### Safety Warnings

⚠️ **High Voltage Present:**
- Radio contains high voltage circuits
- Disconnect power before servicing
- Discharge capacitors properly

⚠️ **RF Exposure:**
- Use appropriate power levels

⚠️ **Static Sensitivity:**
- Use ESD protection when handling repairs
- Ground technician(s) to [ESD mat](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=ESD+mat+kit) to a household 120VAC NEMA 5-15 or 5-20 outlet using [adapters](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=Banana+Jack+Outlet+Adapter+Universal+Ground+3+Prong+Outlet+Earth+Connection)
- Ground ESD mat and adapters to wall outlet.
