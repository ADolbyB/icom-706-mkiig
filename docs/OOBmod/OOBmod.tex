    \textbf{Description of the Problem:}
\end{center}

\hspace{\parindent}This is a modification which allows the radio to transmit out-of-band. Such a modification
is necessary if you are a member of the Military Auxiliary Radio System (MARS), in which out-of-band operation 
is permitted legally on an FCC Part 97 radio meant for the ham bands. This modification is colloquially referred to 
as a ``MARS Mod''.

\hspace{\parindent}DISCLAIMER: Please do not use this modification for anything else, like illegally transmitting 
on the GMRS band. I do not recommended this on a Part 97 Radio. GMRS is FCC Part 95 and as such must use either 
dedicated FCC Part 95 radios for GMRS, or FCC Part 90 radios that are bandsplit appropriately, like a 400 to 470MHz
or a 450MHz to 512MHz band split, either of which will cover the 462MHz and 467MHz channels. 
Another (weak) justification for this modification is the ``Life or Death'' scenario, where the operation 
on any available frequency is allowed in the case of human life in danger. This is a weak case because it is more
applicable to a citizen picking up a police officer's radio and calling in an ``Officer Down, Shots Fired!!'' which
they may have just witnessed. Such a transmission where one is otherwise not permitted to operate is legally 
authorized in such a scenario. Alternatively, calling for help on GMRS from your HAM radio will do you no good!!
