Before working on the radio, please be sure that it is disconnected from all power sources. You
should have a static mat with wriststrap to guard against ESD (Electrostatic Discharge). Only the radio body needs 
to be worked on for this repair, so the head should be removed for that purpose, as shown in Figure 1.1.

    \item \section{Description of the Modification}
\end{center}

This modification allows the radio to transmit out-of-band. Such a modification
is necessary if, for example, you are a member of the Military Auxiliary Radio System (MARS), in which out-of-band 
operation is permitted legally on an FCC Part 97 radio meant for the ham bands. This modification is colloquially 
referred to as a ``MARS Mod''.

DISCLAIMER: Please do not use this modification for anything else, like illegally transmitting 
on the GMRS band or the CB band. I do not recommended this on a Part 97 Radio. For Example: GMRS is FCC Part 95 
and as such must use either dedicated FCC Part 95 radios for GMRS, or FCC Part 90 radios that are bandsplit 
appropriately, like a 400 to 470MHz or a 450MHz to 512MHz band split, either of which will cover the 462MHz and 
467MHz GMRS channels. Another (weak) justification for this modification is the ``Life or Death'' scenario, where 
the operation on any available frequency is allowed in the case of human life in danger. This is a weak case 
because it is more applicable to a citizen picking up a police officer's radio and calling in an ``Officer 
Down, Shots Fired!!'' which they may have just witnessed. Such a transmission where one is otherwise not 
permitted to operate is legally authorized in such a scenario. Alternatively, calling for help on GMRS or CB from 
your HAM radio will do you no good!!

Another DISCLAIMER: I am not a lawyer and the above is not intended to be legal advice in any 
capacity. Do your own research and make sure you have the proper equipment, licenses and know the rules for the 
appropriate RF bands you are operating on. If any of this goes over your head, please stop and have someone with 
the proper knowledge perform this modification.

    \item \section{Modification Procedure}
\end{center}

Starting this modification requires detaching the remote head, and then removing the top cover 
of the IC-706. The top cover is the cover with the speaker, and please note that the speaker can be left attached 
to the cover during the procedure. There are 5 Phillips-style screws: 3 on the face of the top panel, and one on
each side. The cover then flips up toward the front. Refer to Figure 3.1 for a picture with the cover removed.
The speaker wire lead can be disconnected as shown.

After the top cover is removed, left of center on the front board is a row of jumper pads. 
Refer to figure 3.2 for the exact location. The only resistor in the row of jumper pads is the one that must be 
removed.
