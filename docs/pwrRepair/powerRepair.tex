    \item \section{Problem Description}
\end{center}

\medskip
This problem can be described as a random cycling of the radio power, and if severe enough, then the entire 
unit may not turn on. I began to notice this rapid power cycling issue when going over bumps at first, until 
the radio quit entirely and would not power on anymore. This problem is due to a broken trace from what appeared 
to be humidity based corrosion through the PCB solder mask layer due to moisture (humidity) ingress under a black 
rubber pad spacer which was adhered to the PCB on top of this trace. The corrosion eventually wears through the PCB 
trace after the solder mask is deteriorated enough. Most of the work required for the repair is gaining access to 
the underside of the bottom front board.

    \item \subsection{Preliminary Procedure}
\end{center}

\medskip
In order to prevent any Electrostatic Discharge (ESD), an anti-static ESD mat should be used as shown in Figure 2. 
Be sure the mat is grounded properly. An excellent ground source is the ground lug on a household 120VAC NEMA 5-15 
or 5-20 outlet. There are some cheap ground lug outlet adapters as seen
\href{https://www.amazon.com/s?k=Banana+Jack+Outlet+Adapter+Universal+Ground+3+Prong+Outlet+Earth+Connection}
{here [Amazon link]} which convert the ground lug into a banana jack.

\medskip
Using the ground lug adapter and an ESD mat kit, ground the mat to the outlet ground, preferably with the side facing 
away from the technician. At the side facing towards the technician, clip the wrist strap to the other side of the 
ESD mat and put the wrist strap on the non-dominant hand so it does not get in the way. Now the ESD mat and the 
technician are all grounded and at equal potential. If you need to purchase an ESD mat kit, there are some kits 
\href{https://www.amazon.com/s?k=ESD+mat+kit}{here [Amazon Link]}. Note in Figure 3 the alligator clips pull off to 
reveal banana jacks. Detach the head of the radio and place it on the ESD mat. Note that in Figure 5, the top lead 
needs to be connected to the ground lug adapter, and the bottom lead with the wrist strap can be alligator clipped 
to the mat for a proper connection.

\end{figure}

\medskip
If the ESD mat does not have buttons to snap the leads onto (most do), then just use alligator clips to make the 
connection to the mat. This still provides the proper electrical connection needed for equal potential.

\end{center}

\medskip
For this repair to be successful, the front board on the bottom side of the radio must be removed and and flipped
upside down. This is where the rubber pad and broken trace is located. The most care must be taken to unplug the 
2 gray coax cables without damaging them.

% Notice that the black spacer pad on the PCB in Figure 2 has some oxidation on it, as well as 
% where the pad contacts the case on the underside of the PCB. Looking a bit closer reveals a trace running directly 
% underneath the black pad, which is shown in Figure 3 below:

% \end{figure}

% The black pad must be removed to reveal the extent of PCB damage. This is shown in figure 4 
% below. Notice on the left side that removing the black pad results in a thin layer left behind. Next, the board
% must be cleaned and prepped so the broken trace can be soldered back to a closed circuit.
