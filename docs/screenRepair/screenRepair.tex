\medskip
This is a known screen problem described as the LCD screen appearance looks very strange and 
hard to read. In this case, the LCD Polarizer attached to the LCD screen gets old and loses all its polarization 
properties, which results in the following appearance:

\medskip
In order to prevent any Electrostatic Discharge (ESD), an anti-static ESD mat should be used as shown in Figure 5. 
Be sure the mat is grounded properly. An excellent ground source is the ground lug on a household 120VAC NEMA 5-15 
or 5-20 outlet. There are some cheap ground lug outlet adapters as seen
\href{https://www.amazon.com/s?k=Banana+Jack+Outlet+Adapter+Universal+Ground+3+Prong+Outlet+Earth+Connection}
{here [Amazon link]} which convert the ground lug into a banana jack.

\medskip
Using the ground lug adapter and an ESD mat kit, ground the mat to the outlet ground, preferably with the side facing 
away from the technician. At the side facing towards the technician, clip the wrist strap to the other side of the 
ESD mat and put the wrist strap on the non-dominant hand so it does not get in the way. Now the ESD mat and the 
technician are all grounded and at equal potential. If you need to purchase an ESD mat kit, there are some kits 
\href{https://www.amazon.com/s?k=ESD+mat+kit}{here [Amazon Link]}. Note the alligator clips pull off to reveal 
banana jacks. Detach the head of the radio and place it on the ESD mat. Note that in Figure 5, the top lead needs to
be connected to the ground lug adapter, and the bottom lead with the wrist strap can be alligator clipped to the
mat for a proper connection.

\end{figure}

\medskip
If the ESD mat does not have buttons to snap the leads onto (most do), then just use alligator clips to make the 
connection to the mat. This still provides the proper electrical connection needed for equal potential.
